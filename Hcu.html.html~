						The School of Computer and Information Sciences (SCIS) was established as an independent School
					 on Jan 22, 2013. It was initially functioning as a component of School of Mathematics and Computer
					and Information Sciences and later was established as a distinct department, Department of Computer
					and Information Sciences, on 23rd March, 1993.<br><br><br>
					SCIS offers programmes for post-graduate study and research in all major areas of Computing,Informa<wbr>tion
					Science and Artificial Intelligence. The school is unique in offering M.Tech. Programmes in Artific<wbr>ial
					Intelligence (since 1987), and in Information Technology with specialization in Banking Technology and 
					Information Security (since 2001). It has approximately 450 students in the various programmes offered
					by the school.<br><br><br>
					SCIS has been recognized by several funding agencies. Recently, University Grants Commission (UGC) has 
					sanctioned a Special Assistance Program (SAP), at the level of Departmental Research support (DRS) PhaseI
					,to enhance teaching and research programmes. The Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of 
					India has recognized the research contributions of the school by funding it under FIST and PURSE programmes.
					
					<br><br><br>
					The school currently executes several research projects (funded by MIT, UGC, ISRO, DRDO, DLRL, MHA, DST, 
					INCOIS etc.)on Content-Based Image Retrieval, Speech and Natural Language Processing, Grid Computing, 
					Cryptography, Neural Networks, Formal Methods in Software Engineering,Business Process Re-engineering,
					Forensic Document Analysis, System Security and Grid Middleware etc. SCIS maintains active contact with
					both industry and research labs and participates in developing state-of-art computing systems.
					<br><br><br>
					The school has initiated academic collaboration at an international level with United Nations 
					University/International Institute of Software Technology, Macau, University of Trento, Italy 
					and Mahasarakham University, Thailand. The school has MoUs for collaborative work with NISG 
					(National Institute for Smart Government), IBM (ISTL), Sierra Atlantic and Altair Engineering
					to promote research and teaching programmes. The School offers elective courses in collaboration 
					with Hitachi Consulting on Service-Oriented Architecture and with IBM ISL on Big Data and Virtualization.
