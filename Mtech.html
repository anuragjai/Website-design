								<h2>Master of Technology (M.Tech)</h2>
						
				<p align="justify"> M.Tech is meant for graduates in engineering disciplines and postgraduates in 
				related sciences. Three different streams of M.Tech. are offered by the school &ndash; M.Tech(CS),
				M.Tech(AI) and M.Tech(IT) with specialization in Banking Technology and Information Security. Admi
				ssions are open for sponsored and foreign candidates also. These are supernumerary.
				<br/><br/><font color="000" size="+2">M.Tech. (Computer Science) </font><br/> This programme offers
				core courses of  computer science like Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Algorithms, Software
				Engineering at an advanced level. Specialized electives of faculty research interest are offered as
				electives. The course work develops scientific and mathematical approach to computing. Students can
				also specialize in &ldquo;Data  Science&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cyber Security and Computer Forensics&rdquo;
				based on courses taken and the dissertation in these areas. 
				<br/><br/><font color="000" size="+2">M.Tech. (Artificial Intelligence) </font><br/>This programme 
				is meant for students already well equipped in computing sciences and  imparts advanced training in
				all the major areas of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, such as Human Computer
				Interaction, Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence etc. 
				<br/><br/><font color="000" size="+2">M.Tech. (Information Technology) </font><br/> This programme 
				offers specialization in Banking Technology and Information Security and aims at imparting in-depth
				knowledge and state-of- art expertise to the students through innovative learning supported by high
				calibre research and technology leadership to create a pool of responsible and resourceful IT profe
				ssionals, in particular, for the financial-banking sector.</p>

				<b>General Admission Information for M.Tech. Programmes :</b> Admission to programmes in Computer Science,
				Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology courses is based on only GATE scores in Computer Scien
				ce and Information Technology. No entrance examination or any interviews will be conducted.  GATE scores,
				in order of merit, will be the basis for admission which is done by counseling. 
				Students should indicate their preference for the choice of program (whether CS/AI/IT) in the application
				form.  Request for change of option will not be entertained during counseling.  Admission and tuition fees
				for all the three M.Tech. programmes are uniform. Sliding from one branch to another may be allowed  
				subject to availability only upto 1st August 2014.

				<br/><br/><font color="000" size="+1">Sponsored candidates :</font><br/>
				 Five sponsored seats are available for admission into each stream of M.Tech CS, AI and IT. Sponsored 
				 candidates seeking admission in the M.Tech. (CS/AI/IT)  programmes are exempted from the GATE qualifi
				 cation. Candidates with required basic qualifications would be selected through interviews. Employees
				 with a minimum 2 years of work experience in IT companies registered with STPI or NASSCOM or Central
				 Government Organisations can apply for M.Tech. 
				admission in CS/AI. For M.Tech. (IT) those working in Banks/Financial institutions with a minimum of 
				3 years work experience will be considered.   A candidate seeking admission in this category into M.Tech
				. (CS/AI/IT) must submit (along with application) the organization's willingness to pay a sponsorship
